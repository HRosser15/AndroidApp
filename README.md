    This should be a better way to access the Android Studio code.

    It's very basic, but I've pretty much just been figuring out how to get buttons and text boxes to work as well as make new screens (called fragments in this code).

    - FirstFragment = Home Screen (signup button, login button)
    - SecondFragment = LoginPage (username textbox, pw textbox, log in button, back button)
    - ThirdFragment = SignUpPage (username textbox, pw textbox, sign up button, back button)
